This API was developed in the interest of preserving document validity. It does so
by using a two dimensional barcode, called 'Data Matrix' as an electronic document signature.

By incorporating Image Steganography into a Data Matrix image, we can obscure another message
inside, aside from the encoded message of the Data Matrix.

This 'steganographized' Data Matrix image is then used in an electronic document as a digital signature.
