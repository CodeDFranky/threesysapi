This API was developed in the interest of preserving document validity. It does so
by using a two dimensional barcode, called 'Data Matrix' as an electronic document signature.

By incorporating Image Steganography into a Data Matrix image, we can obscure another message
inside, aside from the encoded message of the Data Matrix.
